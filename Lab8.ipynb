    "#### **A. State Transitions (The \"Grammar\")**\n",
    "The transition matrix defines a strict left-to-right topology with a self-loop at the end.\n",
    "*   **Start State:** The model is deterministic at the start, always beginning with **`/s/`** ($P=1.0$).\n",
    "*   **Main Path:** There is a high probability ($0.8$) of moving to the next phoneme in the sequence:\n",
    "    *   `/s/` → `/p/`\n",
    "    *   `/p/` → `/ie:/`\n",

    "### 2. Inference Analysis (Viterbi Algorithm)\n",
    "The Viterbi algorithm is used to decode the most likely sequence of hidden states (phonemes) given a sequence of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Performance Factors**\n",
    "*   **High Accuracy:** The inference is highly accurate (often 100%) for this specific model.\n",
    "*   **Role of Context:** Although `/s/` and `/p/` both emit \"Energy\", the Viterbi algorithm correctly identifies them because the **Transition Probability** heavily penalizes seeing `/p/` at the start or `/s/` after `/s/`. It uses the \"grammar\" to fix the \"noisy sensor.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sample Trace**\n",
    "Given an observation sequence like: `['Energy', 'Energy', 'Pitch', 'Energy']`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1 (`Energy`):**\n",
    "    *   Could be `/s/` or `/p/`.\n",
    "    *   **Inference:** Must be **`/s/`** because Initial Prob for `/p/` is 0.\n",

    "2.  **Step 2 (`Energy`):**\n",
    "    *   Could be `/s/` (loop) or `/p/` (next).\n",
    "    *   **Inference:** **`/p/`** is chosen because the transition `/s/` → `/p/` ($0.8$) is much stronger than `/s/` → `/s/` ($0.1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Step 3 (`Pitch`):**\n",
    "    *   **Inference:** **`/ie:/`** is chosen. It has the highest emission for Pitch ($0.5$) and follows `/p/` with high probability ($0.8$).\n",

    "4.  **Step 4 (`Energy`):**\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Conclusion\n",
    "The model successfully demonstrates how HMMs combine **prior knowledge** (transition rules) with **current evidence** (emissions) to resolve ambiguity. Even if the acoustic signal (observation) is identical for two steps (e.g., \"Energy\", \"Energy\"), the model knows that the underlying phonemes must be different (`/s/` then `/p/`) based on the learned sequence structure.\n",
